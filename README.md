#  Test STG4
Test STG4 is an experimental bullet hell engine for iOS and macOS to create Touhou-style games

The engine is a sequel to [Test STG 2 in Java](https://github.com/XiaoGeNintendo/-LibGdx-Test-STG2) and [Test STG 3 in Danmakufu](https://github.com/XiaoGeNintendo/xiaogenintendo/releases/tag/STG01A)

# Termination
This project is (probably) terminated due to the following reasons:
- Overestimation of Spritekit's performance
- Loss of interest due to the coding complexity and difficulty
- Repulsive system design which blocks the future development

I feel extremely sorry for the 0 people who are waiting excitedly for this project and the 0 financial supporters.
